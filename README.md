Built on the pattern Andrej Karpathy described in his [LLM Wiki gist](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f): instead of retrieving from raw documents at query time (classic RAG), an LLM incrementally **compiles** your sources into a structured, cross-linked markdown wiki that sits between you and the raw documents. The wiki is a **persistent, compounding artifact** — the cross-references are already there, the contradictions have already been flagged, the synthesis already reflects everything you've read.

You never write the wiki yourself. The LLM does all the grunt work: summarizing, cross-referencing, filing, bookkeeping. You bring the sources and ask the questions.

Runs 100% locally on Apple Silicon or anywhere Ollama works. No API keys, no cloud, no data leaving your machine.

## What it does

```bash
# Drop files in (PDFs, markdown, HTML, DOCX, text)
wiki add ~/Documents/papers --recursive

# Watch Qwen3 read them and build an interlinked wiki
wiki ingest

# Ask questions — it searches the compiled wiki and cites its sources
wiki query "what's the main argument about X?"

# Health-check the knowledge base
wiki lint --fix

# Browse the whole thing in Obsidian (graph view, backlinks, everything)
open wiki/
```

Every ingest produces a cluster of `sources/`, `entities/`, and `concepts/` pages with YAML frontmatter and `[[wikilinks]]` between them. Every query pulls the top-ranked pages via hybrid BM25 + vector + LLM-rerank search, then synthesizes a cited answer. Every lint run catches broken links, orphan pages, malformed frontmatter, and (optionally, using the LLM) contradictions between pages.

## Features

### Core capabilities
- **Incremental ingest** — drop a file, run `wiki ingest`, get 8–15 cross-linked wiki pages
- **Structured extraction** — Qwen3 identifies entities (people, organizations, places), concepts (models, techniques, architectures, ideas), and key takeaways per source, always framed around the problem being solved and its limitations
- **Smart merging** — re-ingesting related sources updates existing entity/concept pages instead of overwriting them, preserving provenance
- **Hybrid search** — BM25 full-text + vector embeddings + LLM reranking (all local, via [QMD](https://github.com/tobi/qmd))
- **3-way query scope** — `Wiki` (thematic answers from LLM-compiled pages), `Raw` (exact lookups in original documents), or `Hybrid` (both)
- **Intent classification** — casual messages ("hi", "thanks") skip retrieval and get a quick reply, saving ~30 seconds per chitchat turn
- **Cited synthesis** — queries return markdown answers with `[[wikilinks]]` pointing to the pages that support each claim
- **Write-back** — save good answers as new `synthesis/` pages with `--save-as`, so your explorations compound in the knowledge base
- **Wiki linting** — automated health checks for broken links, orphans, malformed frontmatter, noise in sources, and (with `--deep`) LLM-powered contradiction detection between pages
- **Auto-fix** — most stylistic issues resolve with one command
- **Auto-reindex** — search index refreshes automatically after ingest and lint; new pages are queryable immediately

### Web UI
A full web interface at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` after `wiki serve`:
- **Dashboard** — project stats and recent activity
- **Sources** — list, inspect, delete, or re-ingest sources with one click
- **Ingest** — drag-and-drop upload, live progress log, persistent jobs that **survive tab close and server restart**
- **Jobs** — history of all ingest runs with live progress bars and error details
- **Query** — chat-style interface with streaming synthesis, scope toggle, save-as-synthesis button
- **Lint** — interactive lint report with one-click auto-fix
- **Graph** — D3 force-directed visualization of the full wiki, color-coded by page type

### Supported input formats
`.pdf` · `.md` · `.html` · `.docx` · `.txt`

### Obsidian integration
The `wiki/` folder is a ready-made Obsidian vault with:
- Color-coded graph view (sources, entities, concepts, synthesis each get their own color)
- YAML frontmatter compatible with the Dataview plugin
- All cross-references as native `[[wikilinks]]` so backlinks, outgoing-links, and graph traversal all work

## Architecture

Three layers, per Karpathy:

```
┌───────────────┐   ┌───────────────┐   ┌───────────────┐
│   raw/        │ → │   LLM Agent   │ → │   wiki/       │
│ Your docs     │   │  (Qwen3-14B)  │   │ Markdown,     │
│ (immutable)   │   │               │   │ auto-linked   │
└───────────────┘   └───────────────┘   └───────────────┘
                          │                     │
                          ▼                     ▼
                    ┌───────────────┐   ┌───────────────┐
                    │ schema/       │   │   Obsidian    │
                    │ AGENTS.md     │   │  graph view   │
                    │ (the rules)   │   │  + editing    │
                    └───────────────┘   └───────────────┘
```

- **`raw/`** — your source documents. Immutable. The agent reads but never modifies.
- **`wiki/`** — LLM-maintained markdown. One folder per page type (`sources/`, `entities/`, `concepts/`, `synthesis/`) plus auto-generated `index.md` and `log.md`. Open this in Obsidian.
- **`schema/AGENTS.md`** — the conventions file. Tells the LLM how to format pages, when to merge vs create, how to cite, how to handle contradictions. Edit as your preferences evolve.
- **`.wiki/`** — internal state: SQLite ingest history, QMD search index, config, and per-source diagnostic logs (`.wiki/logs/`). Git-ignored.

### The ingest pipeline

Each source goes through three LLM passes:

1. **Extraction** (thinking mode on) — Qwen3 reads the source and returns structured JSON: a summary that leads with the problem being solved, key takeaways (including what's novel and what's limited), named entities (people, organizations, places only), concepts (models, techniques, architectures, and other ideas), tags. LLM calls retry automatically once after a 5s backoff on failure, and a per-source diagnostic log is written to `.wiki/logs/` for troubleshooting.
2. **Page drafting** (streaming, thinking mode off) — one call per entity/concept. Draft a new page from scratch, or *merge* new information into an existing page (preserving prior content, updating dates, appending to `sources:` frontmatter).
3. **Source summary** — write the `sources/<slug>.md` page listing every wiki page touched by this source for provenance.

After the three passes: `index.md` is rebuilt, `log.md` is appended, and QMD's search index is updated automatically.

### The query pipeline

1. **Hybrid search** via QMD — BM25 full-text + vector similarity + LLM reranker, all local
2. **Top-K page hydration** — load full content of the top 5–8 hits
3. **Synthesis** — Qwen3 writes a cited markdown answer using `[[wikilinks]]` to reference the pages
4. **(Optional) save-back** — `--save-as` files the answer as a new `synthesis/` page

| Parsers | pypdf, python-docx, beautifulsoup4, lxml | Cover the main document formats |
| Vault | [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) | Best-in-class graph view and backlink UX — you don't have to build it |

No cloud services. No API keys. No data leaves your machine.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.11+**
- **Node.js 18+** (for QMD)
- **Ollama** with the `qwen3:14b` model pulled (~9.3GB). 
  You can specify your preferred model in `config.yml`.
- **QMD** (`npm install -g @tobilu/qmd`)
- **Homebrew SQLite** on macOS (`brew install sqlite`)
- **~15GB free disk space** for models and embeddings
- **~12GB RAM** recommended (16GB+ for comfort)
- **Obsidian** (optional but strongly recommended for browsing)

Tested on macOS (Apple Silicon, M3 Pro 18GB). Should work on Linux; Windows untested.

## Installation

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/llm-wiki.git
cd llm-wiki

# Create a virtual environment (uv is faster than pip, either works)
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e .

# Pull the LLM (one-time, ~9.3GB)
ollama pull qwen3:14b

# Install QMD (the search backend)
npm install -g @tobilu/qmd

# Verify
wiki version
wiki --help
```

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Create a wiki in a folder of your choosing
mkdir my-wiki && cd my-wiki
wiki init

# 2. Drop some source documents in raw/, or use:
wiki add ~/Documents/papers --recursive

# 3. Run ingest (interactive by default — shows you entities/concepts
#    before filing, with a y/n prompt per source)
wiki ingest

# First query triggers QMD to download its embedding + reranker models
# (~2GB, one-time). Subsequent queries are fast.

# 4. Ask questions
wiki query "what are the main themes across these documents?"

# 5. Save a good answer as a synthesis page
wiki query "compare X vs Y" --save-as x-vs-y-comparison

# 6. Health-check and auto-fix
wiki lint --fix

# 7. Browse the vault in Obsidian
open wiki/   # then "Open folder as vault"
```

## Example output

A real ingest against `notes.txt` (28 words about Qwen3):

```
Source #1  raw/notes.txt
  parsing…
  extracting entities and concepts (thinking mode)…

Title: Quick Notes on Qwen
Slug:  quick-notes-on-qwen

Summary:
  Qwen is a family of large language models developed by Alibaba Cloud.
  The latest version, Qwen3, introduces a thinking mode designed to enhance
  performance on complex reasoning tasks.

Entities (1):
  + alibaba-cloud (organization)  Alibaba Cloud

Concepts (3):
  + qwen                                  Qwen
  + qwen3                                 Qwen3
  + thinking-mode-for-complex-reasoning   Thinking Mode for Complex Reasoning

File these? Will create/update ~5 wiki pages. [Y/n]: Y

created entity alibaba-cloud
created concept qwen
created concept qwen3
created concept thinking-mode-for-complex-reasoning
created source  quick-notes-on-qwen

✓ Ingested Quick Notes on Qwen — 5 created, 0 updated
```

That's **5 cross-linked pages from a 28-word input**, each with YAML frontmatter, `[[wikilinks]]` between them, and provenance back to the source. Open Obsidian's graph view and you'll see the cluster light up.

A real query against 11 ingested pages:

```
> wiki query "how does multi-head attention differ from self-attention?"

  searching wiki (BM25 + vector + rerank)…
  found 8 relevant page(s):
    1. 0.93 concepts/multi-head-attention.md      Multi-Head Attention
    2. 0.55 concepts/self-attention-mechanism.md  Self-Attention Mechanism
    3. 0.40 entities/attention-is-all-you-need.md Attention is All You Need
    ...

  synthesizing answer…

Multi-head attention and self-attention are related but distinct mechanisms:

1. **Scope and Parallelism**
   - Self-attention is a single mechanism where each position in the input
     computes attention weights based on all other positions
     [[concepts/self-attention-mechanism]].
   - Multi-head attention extends this by using multiple parallel attention
     heads, allowing the model to focus on diverse patterns simultaneously
     [[concepts/multi-head-attention]].

2. **Information Capture**
   - Self-attention focuses on a single representation.
   - Multi-head aggregates information from multiple heads, each capturing
     different aspects (syntactic vs semantic, etc.)
     [[concepts/multi-head-attention]].

[... etc.]
```

Every claim is cited. Every citation points to a page that actually exists.
