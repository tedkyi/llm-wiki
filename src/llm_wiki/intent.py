"""Intent classification — decide whether a query is wiki-relevant or chitchat.

A separate, fast LLM call before retrieval saves time on small talk like
'hi', 'how are you', 'thanks' — which would otherwise trigger an 8-page
retrieval and synthesis pipeline that wastes ~30 seconds for nothing.

The classifier returns one of two labels:
    - 'wiki'      → proceed with normal retrieval + synthesis
    - 'chitchat'  → respond conversationally without searching

We deliberately bias toward 'wiki' on ambiguous cases. Wasting one retrieval
on an edge case is better than missing a real research question.
